                        <h2>Find a space</h2>See if you can get outside a classroom because classrooms tend to have negative connotations for learners.

                        <div class="well example">
                            <ul>

                                    <strong>an Independent Cafe</strong>

                                    <p>Buy your event snacks and drinks (or have participants buy their own) at a local cafe in exchange for a reserved space.

                                    <strong>the Local Library</strong> <img src="http://media.mozillarian.org/2014/01/Screenshot-2014-01-12-14.28.13.png" alt="library" style="width:300px;">

                                    <p>Libraries are community hubs, and librarians are usually enthused about having digital literacy events take place in their spaces. Just take a look at <a href="http://mozillarian.org/2014/01/09/librarians-in-the-digital-age-infographic/">this infographic</a>!</p>

                                    <p>Be sure you reserve a comfortable venue where you can move the chairs and sit together in a circle. Ensure there is Internet, power and good lighting. Nearby Hackerspaces are usually perfect for an event!</p>

                                    <strong>a Museum</strong> <img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/9758283774_5489963eb4.jpg" alt="Museum" style="width:300px;"> <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/saliyath/" class="attribution">Photo by Thalia Papoutsaki</a>

                                    <p>Plan to tie in topics relevant to the museum, then speak with the museum director about your event. Ask the museum if they'll require an admission fee.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Spread the Word</h2>

                        <p>Personally invite as many learners as possible to your club and use your networks to get the word out. Remember to recruit a number of facilitators proportionate to the number of learners you anticipate attending club. We like a ratio of 1:8 or 1:12 facilitators to learners, but if people are engaged with the work - and you are super prepared - you can sometimes get away with something more like 1:20.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Set up a Site</strong> You will share your planning process and ideas widely. Create a page for your event. You can use webmaker.org (soon), wordpress.com, blogger.com, or tumblr.com to create a free page (free is good).</li>

                                <li><strong>Get Creative</strong> Show the world what you are up to with consistent posts to social media site including: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube/ Vimeo and blogs. Get creative and make your own buzz in these spaces.</li>

                                <li><strong>Define a Hashtag</strong> Create a hashtag for the event. Throughout the event have participants and your crew tweet and post on social networks.</li>

                                <li><strong>Craft a Press Release</strong> A press release is usually a one-page document describing your event, your organization and anything noteworthy that you might want to communicate. This document should be carefully written as reporters will refer to it when writing their stories. Remember to include clear contact information so that members of the media know who to follow up with. Here's an example: <img src="https://p2pu.org/media/uploads/images/LauraHilliger/2012/02/09/newsletter.png" style="float:none;"></li>

                                <li><strong>Beef Up Your Contacts</strong> Send out the press release at least a week before the event. Notify Mozilla as well as mainstream media outlets in your community — newspapers, TV and radio — think about other outlets and organizations that could spread the word about your jam. Use talking points to follow up with these contacts.</li>
