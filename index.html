## Experimenting with Github

In 2015, the Webmaker community will be testing various pieces and parts for [the Webmaker Clubs initiative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/2015/Mentors/Clubs). This implementation of [P2PU's Course-in-a-Box](http://howto.p2pu.org) is an experiment on creating remixable Web literacy curriculum.

First we play, then iterate, then play, then when we figure out what we're doing, we write decent documentation ;)
