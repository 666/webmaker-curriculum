Webmaker Clubs curriculum (alpha)
=================================

*Click on the 'watch' button to be informed of updates!*

In 2015, Mozilla is working with the community on [Webmaker Clubs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/2015/Mentors/Clubs) (name TBC). The idea is to address the following problems:

* **higher quality teaching and learning.** How can the teaching and learning experience be improved for mentors and learners?
* **local community networks.** How can local learning communities grow stronger and more networked through Webmaker?
* **contributor retention.** How can mentors be encouraged engage with Webmaker longer?

There will be a number of different kinds of clubs, all of which require initial guidance. The draft of a curriculum arc for clubs is available at http://mzl.la/club_curriculum

This repository is to create a generic curriculum that can be forked for use in specific contexts. These will vary based on sector, geographical location and focus of each club. 

To fork this repository:

1. Create a GitHub account and login
2. Hit the 'Fork' button to the top-right of this page
3. Edit the repository for your own needs

For the third step, you can edit each document in-situ on GitHub (easiest), or you can use the native client (slightly trickier, but better results). Either way, you'll need to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to format the pages. 

If you have changes to suggest to *this* repository, please fork it and then submit a pull request. Guidance on how to do this can be found in the [GitHub help section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
