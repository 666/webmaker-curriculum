#Web Literacy Basics I (3 sessions)

In this module, learners begin to learn about what makes the web a unique place to find and gather information. They'll learn about how the web is constructed, and  together, we'll begin collecting assets to build a webby projects around.

##Learning Objectives and Assessment

By the end of this module, learners should be able to: 

* access the web using the common features of web browsers
* use hyperlinks to access a range of resources on the web
* manage information from various sources on the web
* locate or find desired information within search results
* research the authorship and ownership of websites and their content.

Learners should also be aware that:

* remixing is a form of derivative artwork.
* media has influence over culture and society, and cultures and societies have influence over shaping media.
* the Web is made out of building blocks that they can rearrange to create new things through an iterative process.
