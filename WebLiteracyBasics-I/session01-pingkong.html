                            <h4>Introduction Round</h4>

                            <p>Ask learners “How do you get to the Internet?” Take a few ideas/guesses from the group, then explain the following: </p>
                            
                            <div class="well example">
                              <em>Anytime you ask the Internet to do something, whether by entering a URL into a browser or watching a video on youtube, your internet request hops through several network devices, like routers and switches and servers, on its way from your computer to the website’s server.</em>
                            </div>

                            <p> Explain to learners that to help them understand this path, they're going to act out a human ping/tracert in an obstacle course: traveling from a local computer through a LAN to the Internet to get to Google.com (or a website of your choice) </p>

                        </div>
                    </li>

                                min</p>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Model the Obstacle Course</h4>
                            <p>
                              Ask the group to gather underneath the "My computer" sign and ask for three volunteers.
                            </p> 

                            <p> Hand three of the volunteers the signs labelled "Hop 1: Local Router," "Hop 2: Internet Service Provider and "Hop 3: The Website Company's Router" and ask them to spread out throughout the room.</p>

                            <p>Explain that the students with the signs all represent different "hops" that an Internet request must go through before it gets to the website a user is looking for. The rest of the students are packets of computer code trying to get to the {FIX}!!! </p> 

                              <p>Choose one of these “packet” students to act as a model for the rest of the group before they all start the activity.  Tell the students the following:</p>

                              <div class="well example">
                                <em>I’m at my computer and I decide to watch a video on YouTube. After I type in the web address, my computer converts ‘youtube.com’ into a code that all computers can read and then divides that code into several internet “packets”.  This volunteer student represents one of those packets.</em>
                              </div>    

                            <p> Ask the example student to walk to the “Hop 1: Local Router” and explain:</p>

                            <div class="example-div">
                              <em>First the packet will hop through local network devices like routers, switches or modems in your building.  The local network devices then send the packet to the Internet.</em> 
                            </div>   

                            <p> Ask the example student to walk to  “Hop 2: Internet Service Provider” and explain:</p>   

                            <div class="example-div">
                              <em>After a packet gets here, to the Internet service provider,  it is sent all the way to one of YouTube’s routers. </em>
                            </div>   

                            <p> Ask the example student to walk to “Hop 3: Company Router” and explain:</p>

                            <div class="example-div">
                              <em>Once the packet gets through YouTube's router, it is sent to a computer in the company's headquarters that will stream my video. </em>
                            </div>   

                            <p> Ask the example student to walk to the "Website" sign and explain:</p>     

                            <div class="example-div">
                              <em>In order to get the video to stream on my computer, YouTube’s computer converts my video into packets too, which travel all the way back to my computer on the same path of network devices it took to get to YouTube. </em>
                            </div>   

                            <p> Ask the example student to walk back to you, making sure to pause at each hop on the way back. When the student returns, ask if anyone knows how the devices at each hop know exactly where to send a packet. If no one knows, explain:</p>  

                            <div class="example-div">
                              <em>They use IP addresses!  Every device or computer in a network or online has an IP (or “Internet Protocol”)  address.  It’s like a home address - and it helps devices find each other and communicate.  IP addresses have 4 sets of numbers in a string like this: 172.168.3.12 </em>
                            </div>        
                          </li>

                          <li>
                            <div>
                              <div class="time">
                                <p>10<br>
                                min</p>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Get Going</h4>
                            <p>Now it's time for everyone to try the obstacle course! </p>

                            <p>Explain to the students that they are all “packets” trying to make their way to Google.com (or the website you chose) to complete someone’s Internet request. They must stop at each “hop” before moving on to the next one. </p>

                            <p><strong> But wait, there's a twist!</strong> Before the packets can get from one hop to the next, they must complete a quick challenge posed by the student acting as the Hop.  <em>Examples: Do 5 jumping jacks! Sing “Happy Birthday” etc. </em></p>

                            <p>When the packet completes the Hop's challenge, the Hop will allow the packet to move the next location until the packets reach "The Website". </p> 

                            <p>Ask the packets to form a single-file line and move through the obstacle course as quick as they can! You can have someone time how long it takes everyone to get through the course to see who makes it the fastest.</p>
                        </div>
